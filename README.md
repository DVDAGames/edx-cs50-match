# edX CS50 Introduction to Game Development: Match 3

This is `Project 3` for [CS50's Introduction to Game Development](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/).

The game is a variation of classic Match 3 mechanics, where the player must swap tiles to match 3 or more of the same type in a row or column to score points. The game features a timer, which when runs out, the game ends.

The goal of the project is to take the provided [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) project and add several features to it:

- [x] Increment timer for each match
- [ ] Only start with simple tiles instead of pulling from every tile variation
- [ ] Add random "shiny" variant blocks that will clear a whole row on matching and add points for each block in the row
- [ ] Only allow swapping when it results in a match
- [ ] (_Optional_) Implement mouse-based controls
